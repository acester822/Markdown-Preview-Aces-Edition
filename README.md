## What's New in Aces Edition

This isn't just a reskin. Every major pain point in the original extension has been tackled head-on.

### ♠️ The Default Theme: None

A brand-new custom preview theme built exclusively for this fork. Dark, vivid, punchy — it makes your markdown look incredible. Neon syntax highlighting, clean heading hierarchy, and a layout that actually breathes.

### ⚡ Completely Overhauled Preview UX

The old preview toolbar is gone. In its place: a sleek **floating action menu** that stays out of your way until you need it. All the common actions are right there — no hunting through menus, no wasted screen space.

### 📋 Code Block Copy Actions

Every code block in the preview now has instant copy actions built right in:

- **Copy Code** — grabs just the raw code
- **Edit In-Place** — opens the inline editor; or just double-click any element directly in the preview
- **Copy Markdown** — copies the full fenced block
- **Export as PNG** — Still a WIP but it is coming!

One click. Done.

### 🔢 Line Numbers & Source Mapping

Line numbers are now fully supported in the preview. Even better — the highlight and source mapping behavior has been significantly improved, so jumping between your preview and your source file actually works reliably.

### 🔗 Backlinks & TOC Improvements

The sidebar TOC and backlinks workflow has been overhauled with better in-preview controls. Navigation is faster and more intuitive, especially for longer documents.

---

### 📦 Lean, Fast VSIX — 99% Smaller

This was a serious problem in the original: the official extension VSIX shipped **48,474 files (146 MB)** because `node_modules` and build artifacts were being bundled in.

Aces Edition ships **485 files at 16 MB**. That's a **99% reduction in file count**. It installs instantly and doesn't bloat your extensions folder.

### 🃏 Ace of Spades Icon

The extension icon is the Ace of Spades. Because of course it is.

---

### 🔧 Ongoing Upstream Merges & Hardening

Parser and rendering fixes, markdown transform updates, and dependency updates are continuously merged from upstream MPE/Crossnote — plus local hardening and fixes on top.
