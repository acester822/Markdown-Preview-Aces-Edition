## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `src/webview/components/InlineEditor.tsx`, `styles/preview.less`: **Inline editor bottom-anchor retool.** Removed the `[rect, value]` scroll effect that was creating a feedback loop (scroll → setRect → re-render → re-scroll) making the editor glitch as content grew. The overlay is now `position:fixed; bottom:16px` — it grows upward with content and never clips below the viewport. A single one-time `requestAnimationFrame` scroll on open nudges the page up so the target element stays visible above the editor area. Textarea gains `max-height: 48vh` + `overflow-y: auto` for internal scrolling when content is very long. Removed `document.body.style.paddingBottom` manipulation (no longer needed).

- `src/extension-common.ts` (via mpae): See mpae CHANGELOG — save fix via `WorkspaceEdit` applies here too (crossnote bundle is `preview.js`; the extension-side fix is in mpae).


  - *ESC opens outline fixed*: Added `e.stopPropagation()` to the Escape `handleKeyDown` handler. The keydown was bubbling up to the document-level ESC handler in `preview.ts` (which toggles the sidebar TOC), causing the outline to open on every save.
  - *Save stale closure fixed*: Added `valueRef` that mirrors `value` state but is updated synchronously in `onChange` (before React re-renders). `commit()` now reads `valueRef.current` instead of the `value` closure, so it always has the latest textarea content regardless of React render timing. `valueRef` is also initialized from the same `initial` string on editor open. The live-preview effect captures `valueRef.current` into a local `snapshot` variable at effect call time to avoid closure drift inside the `setTimeout`.
  - *Scroll broken fixed*: Removed `getScrollParent` entirely. The previous approach found `.crossnote[data-for='preview']` (which has `overflow: auto` in CSS) but this element has `height: auto` so it never clips — `scrollBy` on it was a no-op. Now uses `document.scrollingElement || document.documentElement` (the actual VS Code webview scroll root). Padding is applied to `document.body`. Scroll uses `scrollTop +=` (instant, not smooth) so `inlineEditElement.getBoundingClientRect()` can be re-read immediately after and `setRect` called to reposition the fixed overlay. Used `requestAnimationFrame` instead of `setTimeout(30)` for correct timing.

- `src/webview/components/InlineEditor.tsx`: **Inline editor fix — save race, cursor capture, scroll container (previous)**
  - *Save race fixed*: Added `liveTimerRef` to track the 350 ms live-preview debounce. `commit()` now cancels the pending timer before doing its own final `postMessage`, eliminating the double-send race that was causing the save to produce corrupted/unexpected output. Backdrop click and Escape still always commit.
  - *Enter key is now a normal newline*: Removed the `Enter→commit` shortcut. The `handleKeyDown` handler now only intercepts Escape; Enter (and Shift+Enter) fall through to the browser's default textarea `\n` insertion. Hint text updated accordingly.
  - *Cursor auto-capture fixed*: Changed `.focus()` from a synchronous `useEffect` call to `setTimeout(..., 80 ms)`. The synchronous call was firing before the double-click's `mouseup` event, which stole focus back to the document. The 80 ms delay ensures focus lands in the textarea after the click sequence completes.
  - *Scroll fix*: Added `getScrollParent()` helper that walks the DOM to find the nearest `overflow: auto/scroll` ancestor. Both the "ensure scroll room" effect (previously `document.body` spacer → now `container.style.paddingBottom = '60vh'`) and the scroll-into-view effect now target the actual preview scroll container instead of `window`. This fixes the case where `window.scrollBy` had no effect because the preview content scrolls inside `.crossnote[data-for="preview"]`, not the window.

- `src/webview/components/InlineEditor.tsx`: **Save on close, live preview, bottom-spacer (previous)**
  - *Save on close*: Backdrop click (`onClick`) and Escape key now both call `commit()` instead of `close()`, so every dismissal path saves changes. Updated hint bar text to reflect this.
  - *Live preview*: Added a `useEffect([value])` with a 350 ms debounce that splices the current textarea value into `workingMarkdownRef` and calls `postMessage('updateMarkdown', ...)` as the user types, so the rendered preview updates in real time. An `isDirtyRef` guards against firing on the initial value load. `workingMarkdownRef` (a local snapshot taken at editor-open time) and `lineRangeRef` (which tracks the current `[start, end]` line range including line-count changes from prior live updates) eliminate races against the container's `markdown` state.
  - *Bottom spacer / scroll fix*: Added `useEffect([inlineEditElement])` that appends a `60vh` invisible spacer div (`#inline-editor-spacer`) to `document.body` while the editor is open, giving the browser enough document height to scroll the editor fully into view even when the target element is the last item on the page. The spacer is removed on close. Changed scroll `useEffect` deps from `[rect]` to `[rect, value]` so the scroll re-runs whenever the textarea grows.

- `src/webview/components/InlineEditor.tsx`: **Context menu compact size** Reduced `--contexify-menu-minWidth` from 240px → 160px, padding 8px → 4px, item content padding `8px 14px` → `4px 8px`, radius 18px → 10px, active-item radius 10px → 6px, separator margin 6px → 3px. Added `font-size: 11px !important` to `.contexify` rule so all menu text scales down proportionally.
- `styles/preview_theme/none.less`: Updated duplicate `--contexify-*` size vars to match the new compact values. Added `font-size: 11px !important` to `.contexify` none-theme rule.
- `styles/preview.less`: **Inline editor glass morphism.** Added `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` and `-webkit-backdrop-filter` to `.inline-editor-overlay`. Changed textarea background from opaque `#1e1e1e` to `rgba(7,7,22,0.72)` and hint bar from `rgba(7,7,26,0.97)` to `rgba(7,7,26,0.75)` so content behind the editor shows through with a frosted-glass effect.
- `src/webview/components/InlineEditor.tsx`: **Inline editor placement below element.** Editor overlay now positions at `top: rect.bottom + 8` (just below the target element) instead of `top: rect.top` (over it). Removed the `visibility: hidden` call that was hiding the element being edited — the element is now fully visible while its source is being edited in the box below. Removed the corresponding visibility-restore cleanup effect. Added `overlayRef` and a new `useEffect([rect])` that calls `window.scrollBy({ top: overflow, behavior: 'smooth' })` if the editor box would extend below the viewport bottom, ensuring it's always fully visible regardless of where the target element sits on the page.

- `styles/preview.less`: **Global UI chrome — Popover Universe neon redesign.** Gooey FAB blobs changed from amber `#eab308` to dark neon (`#07071a` bg, `#00f5ff` icons, cyan fill on hover). Monaco line decoration changed from green to neon cyan. Line-number gutter border/text changed from yellow to neon cyan. `<hr>` gradient changed from warm orange to neon blue→purple. "End of document" final-line text changed to neon cyan with Orbitron font and subtle glow. Inline editor border changed from VS Code blue to neon cyan. Added global `--contexify-*` CSS variable block so the context menu always shows as a dark glass neon panel. Added `.footer>div` neon glass panel (dark bg, neon `border-top`, `backdrop-filter: blur(24px)`). Added `.topbar>div` glass panel globally. Added `.code-chunk-btn-group` neon glass button styling. Added `dialog.modal::backdrop` dark blur + `.modal-box` dark glass neon frame (ImageHelper modal), including drop-zone, input and button overrides.
- `src/webview/components/FloatingActions.tsx`: Changed `gooey-copy-flash` keyframe outline from amber `rgba(234,179,8,…)` to neon cyan `rgba(0,245,255,…)` to match the new FAB palette.
- `styles/preview_theme/none.less`: Replaced incorrect `.floating-action>div>button` selector (class never exists in the component DOM) with correct `.gooey-item,.gooey-toggle` selectors reinforcing neon icon colour and hover state. Added `.footer>div` neon glass override for the none theme.

- `styles/preview_theme/none.less`: Full Popover Universe-inspired theme for the "none" preview theme. Includes an animated star-field background (`body::before`), nebula glow layer (`body::after`), Orbitron/Rajdhani Google Font imports, neon gradient headings (h1–h6 each get a distinct neon color with text-shadow/drop-shadow animations), glass-morphism blockquotes and code blocks (gradient border via mask technique, `backdrop-filter: blur`), neon list markers, neon link styling with hover glow, neon table headers, DaisyUI palette overrides (`--p`, `--s`, `--a`, `--b1-b3`, `--bc`) wired to the neon palette, `react-contexify` context menu CSS variable overrides for a dark glass neon menu, topbar glass-blur panel styling, neon scrollbar styling, floating action button neon halo, and sidebar ToC neon link highlights.

- `src/webview/containers/preview.ts`: Gated the ESC keydown handler (`onKeydownEventHandler`) so it only calls `escPressed` (sidebar TOC toggle) when `inlineEditElement` is `null`. When the inline editor is open, the document-level ESC press is suppressed and the textarea's own `onKeyDown` handler closes the editor cleanly. Added `inlineEditElement` to `onKeydownEventHandler` dep array.
- `src/webview/containers/preview.ts`: Added `dblclick` listener in `bindHighlightEvent` loop alongside the existing `mouseover`/`mouseout` listeners. Double-clicking any `[data-source-line]` element calls `setInlineEditElement(firstHighlightElement)`, opening the inline editor directly without needing the FloatingActions menu.
- `src/webview/components/InlineEditor.tsx`: New component — inline block editor. When activated via the FloatingActions "Edit in place" button, renders a fixed-position `<textarea>` directly over the hovered element, pre-filled with the raw markdown source lines for that block (via `getHighlightElementLineRange` + `markdown`). Enter = write+close, Shift+Enter = newline, Escape = cancel, backdrop click = cancel. On confirm, splices the edited lines back into the full markdown string and calls `postMessage('updateMarkdown', ...)`. The original element is hidden (`visibility: hidden`) while the editor is open and restored on close. Textarea auto-resizes to content height via `scrollHeight` assignment.
- `src/webview/containers/preview.ts`: Added `inlineEditElement: HTMLElement | null` state and `setInlineEditElement` setter; both exported from the container.
- `src/webview/components/FloatingActions.tsx`: Added `mdiPencilOutline` import. Added `setInlineEditElement` and `inlineEditElement` to container destructure. Added "Edit in place" menu item (first in the fan). Added `if (inlineEditElement) return null` guard to hide the fan while an inline edit is in progress. Updated `menuItems` `useMemo` dep array.
- `src/webview/components/Preview.tsx`: Added `InlineEditor` import and `<InlineEditor>` render.
- `styles/preview.less`: Added `.inline-editor-backdrop`, `.inline-editor-overlay`, `.inline-editor-textarea`, `.inline-editor-hint` styles.
- `src/webview/components/MonacoUnderlay.tsx`: Removed full-viewport `div.monaco-click-interceptor` and `handleInterceptorClick` callback. The interceptor was at z-index 5 and blocked all direct pointer events from reaching Monaco (z-index 3), preventing cursor placement by clicking. With the interceptor gone, `pointer-events: none` on the preview ghost (z-4) lets clicks fall through to Monaco natively — cursor position from clicking is now pixel-accurate.
- `src/webview/components/FloatingActions.tsx`: Added `isUnderlayMode` to destructured container values. Added `if (isUnderlayMode) return null` guard after `if (!activeEl) return null`. In underlay mode the preview ghost has `pointer-events: none`, inherited by all its children, so `mouseover`/`mouseout` listeners attached by `bindHighlightEvent` never fire and `highlightElement` is never set. Hiding FloatingActions explicitly prevents a confusing half-present state where the icon briefly appears (from hover state set before entering underlay mode) but immediately becomes unreachable.
- `styles/preview.less`: Removed `.monaco-click-interceptor` CSS block.
- `src/webview/components/MonacoUnderlay.tsx`: Added bidirectional cursor/scroll sync. (1) Monaco cursor → preview ghost scroll: `onDidChangeCursorPosition` with 80 ms debounce finds the preview element whose `data-source-line` is closest (floor) to the cursor line and calls `scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })` on the preview container. (2) Preview click → Monaco cursor jump: a transparent `div.monaco-click-interceptor` (z-index 5, `cursor: text`) sits above the preview ghost; on click it uses `document.elementsFromPoint` to find the deepest preview descendant with a `data-source-line` attribute, converts it to a Monaco 1-based line number, and calls `editor.setPosition` + `editor.revealLineInCenter`.
- `styles/preview.less`: Added `.monaco-click-interceptor` rule (`position: fixed; z-index: 5; cursor: text; background: transparent`).
- `src/webview/components/MonacoUnderlay.tsx`: Added `scrollPreviewToLine` and `handleInterceptorClick` callbacks; updated `handleMount` deps; added `cursorSyncTimerRef` cleanup on unmount.
- `src/webview/components/MonacoUnderlay.tsx`: New component — Monaco Editor rendered as a full-viewport transparent layer behind the preview. Activated via `isUnderlayMode`; unmounts on deactivation (flushing any pending auto-save first). Uses `@monaco-editor/react` with `defaultValue={markdown}` so the editor always starts from the current file content. Changes are auto-saved with a 600 ms debounce via `postMessage('updateMarkdown', ...)`. Supports `vs-dark` / `vs` themes matching the preview theme.
- `src/webview/containers/preview.ts`: Added `isUnderlayMode` boolean state and `toggleUnderlayMode` callback. Toggling adds/removes the `body.underlay-mode` CSS class. Cleanup effect removes the class on unmount. Both exported from the container.
- `src/webview/components/Topbar.tsx`: Added `EyeIcon` / `PencilSquareIcon` imports. Added Monaco edit-mode toggle button (between collapse-all and TOC buttons) — shows `PencilSquareIcon` when in preview mode and `EyeIcon` when in underlay edit mode. Button is highlighted with `text-primary` during active edit mode.
- `src/webview/components/Preview.tsx`: Added `MonacoUnderlay` import and `<MonacoUnderlay>` render alongside `<FloatingActions>`.
- `styles/preview.less`: Added `.monaco-underlay-container` (fixed, full-viewport, `z-index: 3`). Added `body.underlay-mode` overrides — hides scrollbar, fixes preview element to full-viewport with `opacity: 0.12` and `pointer-events: none` at `z-index: 4` so Monaco receives all input.
- `src/webview/containers/preview.ts`: Added `setupSectionCollapse()` — post-processes each `h1`–`h6` in the live preview DOM, wrapping following sibling elements (up to the next same/higher-level heading) in a `div.md-section-body`, and injecting a `button.md-collapse-btn` as the first child of each heading. Collapse state per section is read/written to `localStorage` keyed by source URI + heading tag + source line. Called from `initEvents()` after each render pass.
- `src/webview/containers/preview.ts`: Added `collapseAllSections()`, `expandAllSections()`, and `toggleAllSections()` callbacks. Added `allSectionsCollapsed` boolean state (defaults `false`, resets on preview refresh). Both `allSectionsCollapsed` and `toggleAllSections` are exported from the container.
- `src/webview/components/Topbar.tsx`: Added `ArrowsPointingInIcon` / `ArrowsPointingOutIcon` imports. Added a new topbar button between Refresh and Table-of-contents that calls `toggleAllSections` and swaps its icon based on `allSectionsCollapsed`.
- `styles/preview.less`: Added `.md-collapse-btn` styles (opacity, transition, `::before` chevron character that rotates 90° when `.md-collapse-btn--collapsed`). Added `.md-section-body.md-collapsed { display: none; }`.

### Removed

- `src/webview/components/MarkdownEditor.tsx`: Deleted entire file — in-preview markdown editor feature removed.
- `src/webview/components/Preview.tsx`: Removed `MarkdownEditor` import, `enablePreviewZenMode` and `highlightElementBeingEdited` destructuring, and zen-mode-gated JSX for `FloatingActions` and `MarkdownEditor`. `FloatingActions` now always rendered.
- `src/webview/components/Footer.tsx`: Removed `enablePreviewZenMode` destructuring; footer always uses `justify-between` and always shows reading time.
- `src/webview/components/ContextMenu.tsx`: Removed `enablePreviewZenMode`, `highlightElementBeingEdited`, `setHighlightElementBeingEdited`, `setMarkdownEditorExpanded`, `isPresentationMode` destructuring; removed `mdiSpaOutline` import; removed `toggle-zen-mode` case; replaced "Edit Markdown" submenu (with "Open In-preview Editor") with a single "Open VS Code/External Editor" item; removed "Zen Mode" menu item and adjacent separator.
- `src/webview/components/FloatingActions.tsx`: Removed `highlightElementBeingEdited`/`setHighlightElementBeingEdited` destructuring; removed `mdiPencil` import; removed "Edit Markdown" action from `menuItems`; simplified guard from `!activeEl || !!highlightElementBeingEdited` to `!activeEl`.
- `src/webview/containers/preview.ts`: Removed `highlightElementBeingEdited`/`markdownEditorExpanded` state; removed `enablePreviewZenMode` useMemo; removed zen-mode guard from `bindHighlightEvent` (dep array `[]`); removed `zen-mode` class from `updateHtml` class string and deps; removed `highlightElementBeingEdited` useEffect; removed all five zen/editor fields from return object.
- `src/notebook/types.ts`: Removed `enablePreviewZenMode: boolean` type field and `enablePreviewZenMode: true` default value.
- `styles/preview.less`: Removed `.highlight-element-being-edited` CSS block.

### Changed
- `src/webview/components/FloatingActions.tsx`: Clamp `menuLeft` to `window.innerWidth - ITEM_SPACING - TOGGLE_SIZE - HOT_PAD - 4` so the fan never clips off-screen on wide elements. Replaced separate backdrop div + per-button `onMouseLeave` with a single persistent "hot zone" div: collapsed it covers just the toggle (28×28), open it expands to cover the full fan bounding box. Hot zone owns all `onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave` — entering cancels pending close, leaving schedules it. This fixes the bug where moving left/down from the toggle entered the old backdrop and cancelled the close.
- `styles/preview.less`: Flipped `.gooey-menu`, `.gooey-item`, `.gooey-toggle`, and `.gooey-tooltip` from `right: 0` to `left: 0` to match new left-anchored positioning.

## [0.8.19] - 2023-10-06

### Changes

- Deprecated the `processWikiLink` in `parser.js`. Now `crossnote` handles how we process the wiki link.  
  We also added two more options:
  - `wikiLinkTargetFileExtension`: The file extension of the target file. Default is `md`. For example:
    - `[[test]]` will be transformed to `[test](test.md)`
    - `[[test.md]]` will be transformed to `[test](test.md)`
    - `[[test.pdf]]` will be transformed to `[test](test.pdf)` because it has a file extension.
  - `wikiLinkTargetFileNameChangeCase`: How we transform the file name. Default is `none` so we won't change the file name.  
    A list of available options can be found at: https://shd101wyy.github.io/crossnote/interfaces/NotebookConfig.html#wikiLinkTargetFileNameChangeCase

### Bug fixes

- Reverted the markdown transformer and deleted the logic of inserting anchor elements as it's causing a lot of problems.  
  The in-preview editor is not working as expected. So we now hide its highlight lines and elements feature if the markdown file failed to generate the correct source map.

## [0.8.18] - 2023-10-05

### New features

  This feature is currently in beta.  
  When the editor is open, you can press `ctrl+s` or `cmd+s` to save the markdown file. You can also press `esc` to close the editor.
- Deprecated the VS Code setting `markdown-preview-enhanced.singlePreview`.  
  Now replaced by `markdown-preview-enhanced.previewMode`:

    Only one preview will be shown for all editors.
  - **Multiple Previews**  
    Multiple previews will be shown. Each editor has its own preview.
  - **Previews Only** 🆕  
    No editor will be shown. Only previews will be shown. You can use the in-preview editor to edit the markdown.
- Supported to set attribute to image and link, e.g.:

  ```markdown
  ![](path/to/image.png){width=100 height=100}
  ```
